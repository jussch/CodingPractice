Checkers
===========
###Setup
Make sure you have Colorize installed. If you don't, use: *gem install colorize*

Otherwise just download the file and run *ruby game.rb* in the terminal to play!

###How to Play
If you don't know how to play checkers, look it up on wikipedia.
To correctly input your moves, select your pieces and give them a move coordinate using letter-number input. (Ie. a5 b6)
